   Ideas, suggestions, comments ?

      This script is free of charge but I accept donations, old computers, free shells :))
      In any case, if you have any comment (good or bad) go to www.tclscripts.net.

Minimum requirements:
     o Eggdrop 1.8.x
     o Tcl 8.5 or higher.

Most important features:

    o Multi-channels support: intelligent IRC channel management, every owner(s)/manager(s) can
      customise this script and its component settings for each channel to his liking.
      (add/remove users, activate or disable desired protections, modules or commands)
    o Global boss owner(s) now have the possibility of being able to modify, directly into, their
      eggdrop config file (eggdrop.conf) without having to log on to the shell machine to do that. 
      (i.e. nickname, realname, homechan, chanserv, chanserv username, chanserv password, etc.)
    o Designed for flexibility and ease of use: BlackTools is now 100% flexible to be configured
      via channel, you can set different settings for each channel.
    o Owner(s) timer module system which allows to start timers to execute certain processes (proc)
      and in case you want to kill/stop a timer you can do this through this module too. 
      Also provides and a list of active timers running.
    o Allows you to upload files that match the pattern *.tcl from a url inside your
      eggdrop's scripts directory.
    o Note module system where users can send messages to each other or save personal notes. 
      Also, eggdrop will send notes to global owner(s) to inform them every time is abused
      (banned/can't join a channel).
    o CIDR support, dnslookup support and webirc hosts support.
    o All commands works through private message (PRIVMSG) and possibility that all users, who have
      access to eggdrop, can set their own cmdchar such as '!'.
    o All the warn/kick/ban reasons are highly customizable. 
      Every channel manager can add or remove anything as want easily.
    o The new BlackTools version brings also a new and very well-implemented ban system which performs
      accurate and efficient searches through global banlist and every channel banlists for a better
      management and an easier removal/unban.
    o Perfect navigational system through the pages of every module which has this option and a 
      quote support system module.
    o Protection against botnet (mass) and private floods.
    o And lots of cool features for your eggdrop :)
